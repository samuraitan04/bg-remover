# bg-remover
My own image background remover with streamlit and python

##WHY?##
I made this  project because a lot of websites is asking for money to do such minimal things which isnt even really AI. IT can be done with just a small python library called *rembg* which has prebuilt functions for this. This is specially useful for people who are using background remover for purposes like grapic design and such things.
