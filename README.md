# BG Remover

My own image background remover built with **Streamlit** and **Python**.

---

## Why?

I created this project because many websites charge money for background removalâ€”something that can be achieved with a simple Python library called **`rembg`**, which includes prebuilt functions for this purpose. 

This tool is particularly useful for graphic designers and others who frequently need background removal for images without paying for expensive tools or services.

## Features

- **Upload Image**: Supports PNG, JPG, and JPEG formats.
- **Background Removal**: Automatically removes backgrounds with the help of the `rembg` library.
- **Download Option**: Allows users to download the image with the background removed directly from the app.
